/*Unfortunately I do not know how to implement this data structure in C++. 
  At my old school we worked in Java up through data structures and I have never worked in C++ in a meaningful capacity before this class.
  I could probably figure out how to adapt my knowledge given more time but due to the nature of this quiz that time doesn't exactly exist.
  The conceptual idea would be creating the stack via an object with nodes, variables, and iterators but anything I could quickly churn out
  I'm certain would not be functionable right now.*/
